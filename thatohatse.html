                    <h4>I had the opportunity to serve under Tumeliso’s leadership, where she was president of the Roma Rotaract Club.</h4>
                    <p>Tumeliso has proven to be a diligent and passionate leader. She shows a zealous drive in all her projects that is very admirable. During her tenure as president, Tumeliso coordinated the planting of a peace pole, an activity that had never been carried out in Lesotho. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>While studying at the National University of Lesotho, she showed great intellectual integrity and a deep curiosity for her studies. Tumeliso is one of the few people I know who doesn’t see education as a means to an end but as an end in and of itself. She is a continuous learner and makes for an avid student. When things do not go her way, Tumeliso will improvise. This was made evident by the waitressing job she took after she left the University. She embraced the job and served her clients heartily.</p>
                    <p>With her tenacious character, I believe that Tumeliso will go far in life and that she will continue making a profound impact in society.</p>
