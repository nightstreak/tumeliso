                    <p>I am pleased to herein recommend to you Ms. Tumeliso Marumo. I have known Tumeliso from different socio-economic platforms. I work as Principal Accreditation and Compliance Officer for Council on Higher Education (CHE) Lesotho and also as an Administrator for Believers Harvest World Church. I interacted with Tumeliso during the time she was responsible for organizing fundraising activities for our youth department. Tumeliso has been responsible for various youth events among youth subsector nationally. She has been also in charge of some youth movie screening and promoting youth events &nbsp;on radio .</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, she has demonstrated excellent communication and interpersonal skills in her interactions with her fellow youth. She has also proved to be an engaging and humorous host (MC) while hosting some of our annual church events.</p>
                    <p>In addition, it is worth noting that as a church administrator, I witnessed Tumeliso’s active engagement in leadership roles as a Youth Leader and facilitator of major church events. She has been able to produce timely reports for her youth department,</p>
                    <p>while on the other hand, she was a useful team member through asking helpful questions and clarifying critical issues in all the church meetings she participated.</p>
                    <p>I am in no doubt that Ms. Marumo will satisfy the requirements of her new career aspiration she wishes to pursue.</p>
