                    <h4>My first encounter with Tumeliso Marumo was at the Roma Rotaract Club; a charity organization part of rotary international situated at the National University of Lesotho.</h4>
                    <p>At the time, I was the part of the Club Services committee while she was the vice president of the club, meaning I worked under her. Such responsibilities as club events, logistics and increasing the club’s awareness both locally (within the Manonyane community) and outside the vicinity were my responsibility working in direct conjunction with Ms. Marumo.</p>
                    <p>At the core of it, marketing is about using available resources to cement the brand name further into the market. This requires exceptional coordination and planning, these are key qualities Ms Marumo has displayed in vice presidency working her way up the ranks to presidency. The Roma Rotaract Club operated under considerably low resources and sometimes under demotivating circumstances. Her energy kept the members of the club very well motivated and eager to efficiently implement charity and fund-raising projects.</p>
                    <p>In her Presidency, I served under her as the vice President of the club. we were able to execute a number of key projects such as the Singles Night event which, through intensive planning and marketing, was able to mobilize more than 100 NUL students &nbsp;and raise more than M3000.00. we also had The Syria Project; facilitated by Ms. Thatohatsi Sefuthi and coordinated by Ms. Marumo. The project was a crowdfunding project which raised M12 000.00 and also erected the second Peace Pole in Southern Africa. Both these projects were demanding and required sound coordination and planning. Ms Marumo maintained to the highest of rotary standards while still being able to be an excellent leader to the club for other related activities.</p>
                    <p>Having Well defined goals and standards, and most importantly, knowing the "WHY" well enough to eloquently portray it to the concerned stakeholders, regardless of the challenges faced, under her leadership, we met targeted goals and demands. I have complete faith in her abilities to not only communicate the message the right way to the targeted group &nbsp;but to also increase the Return on Investment (ROI) on invested projects.</p>
                    <p>Ms Marumo’s continued work at the Rotaract Club has led to her continued reinstatement as part of the Club’s executive and key figure in marketing, planning crowdfunding, charity fund-raising projects and most importantly, the overall image of the brand. I have no doubt she will add value in her position to add value where she is placed as her work will be displayed in her unwavering passion for marketing and coordinating.</p>
